Attending an expert-led course is the best way to boost Java skills. No online course can compare with live learning, when when you work in a group of like-minded people, ask questions and learn from industry practitioners. 

**I manually collected the ultimate list of training courses offered by different European training providers and individuals.** This is the list of all Java courses I am aware of. All the information here has been compiled correctly to the best of my knowledge. If some great Java training is missing, let me know.
