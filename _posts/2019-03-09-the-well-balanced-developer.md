It's not a secret that some developers are worth more than others. That's all because some developers can make a significant organization impact, whereas others canâ€™t.

> The bigger impact you can make on the organization, the higher is your worth.

To make an impact on the organization, [the principal developer](2019/02/15/the-principal-developer/) keeps 5 essential skills in balance:

* Technical skills
* Mentoring skills
* Process Organization skills
* Business skills
* Communication skills

Sometimes I ask [my trainees](https://principal.dev) to measure their proficiency in each area from 0 to 10. Then we plot results on **the balance wheel**. I yet to find a developer who will draw a shape other than The Imperial Star Destroyer:

You can see a major disbalance and skew towards technical skills. The balance wheel provides a visual indication of where developers invest most of their time.

### Technical skills

At the beginning of career, technical skills are the most important and should be your primary focus. You will be making an organization impact by writing code, fixing bugs and completing assigned tasks.

You will learn about clean code, design patterns, and extreme programming. After years of deliberate practice, you'll be able to ship software features fast and with high quality. You'll start noticing and fixing the mess introduced by less experienced developers.

You will continue pumping technical muscles. That will further increase **the professional gap** between your and your teammates. Youâ€™ll start complaining about your teammates because they do not meet your expectations and their code sucks.

Congratulations. You have reached a major career milestone.

From now on, your primary responsibility will be reducing the professional gap between teammates.

### Mentoring skills

With your remarkable technical skills you can do everything yourself, strictly police all code commits, hijack the architecturally significant tasks and let others do only HTML and CSS. Eventually, you will become the bottleneck and put the company at risk due to [the bus factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor).

> The principal developer must reduce the professional gap between teammates.

Mentoring and building an A-class team requires certain skills. The brightest technical minds are often the worst mentors because dealing with irrational people is harder than feeding computers with instructions. A good mentor must gain trust, inspire, give constructive feedback, understand when to push harder and when to back off.

Until you shrink the professional gap between you and teammates, you have to switch focus from individual contribution to mentoring.

For me, the hardest part was to stop being an individual contributor. Gone are the days when I could proudly say "I shipped features A, B, and C... ðŸ’ª". Most of the time I am saying "I am working on feature A with Alex and feature B with Kate."

### Process Organization skills

You can grow an army of super-skilled developers, but they wonâ€™t perform well if the process sucks. A good process multiplies performance, makes customers happy and competitors envy.

A small change to the process can multiply the throughput and productivity of the organization. By understanding development processes and their optimization, you can make a significant organization impact and become a hero.

Most developers believe that process optimization is not their responsibility. Don't you see the opportunity? Learn the principles of Lean software development [^leanBooks], acquire unique skills, take your money and run.

### Business skills

Most developers work on existing products and implement someone else's ideas. When ideas become boring, we are dreaming about building our product. But you donâ€™t need to become an entrepreneur and leave the company to work on cool stuff. **An intrapreneur is a person who behaves like an entrepreneur while working in an organization**.

Developers are the best candidates for intrapreneurship because no one else in the company can build a product without help.

**Let me tell you a short story**. Once I wanted to build a fancy dashboard for one of the projects. My team leader didnâ€™t buy it, so I coded a barely working prototype in my spare time. Thanks to caffeine, it took me only 20 hours. I showed the prototype to the customers and, to my surprise, they liked it. They allowed me to devote half of my working time for the project and use tools of my choice. I became the exception to some corporate policies, did not have to fill timesheets, could dictate my rules of the game and wear slippers. I got the full Corporate Bullshit Immunity (CBI). So can you.

**You don't need to ask permission to innovate**. Just do it! Grab a lunchbox, open your mac, build a prototype, invite top management, make a nice demo, ask for funding. Even if you get no funding, business people will stop treating you as a geek.

Your mentoring skills mixed with business skills can turn the whole team into innovation machine. I can't imagine a bigger organization impact.

### Communication skills

Last but not less important is communication â€“ the cornerstone of five skills. Unless you are the creator of Git and Linux, lack of diplomatic communication skills is unforgivable.

**Developers are masters of water cooler ~~conversations~~ complaints**. That's why the demand for diplomatic communicators has always been higher than the supply. By learning to negotiate scope with product owners, discussing project risks with customers, bridging the gap between technical and business people you gain **rare skills that never go out of date**.

The only way to improve communication is to communicate a lot. Hang out with non-technical people. When at home, talk less about work. Use every opportunity to speak in front of the audience.

### Wrap up

The bigger impact you can make on the organization, the higher is your worth. For the maximum impact, you should keep 5 primary skills in balance:

* Technical skills
* Mentoring skills
* Process Organization skills
* Business skills
* Communication skills

Use the balance wheel to identify your strenghts, weaknesses and competencies that require more attention than others.

**Are your skills in balance or you are The Imperial Star Destroyer?**
