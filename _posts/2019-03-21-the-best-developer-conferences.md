Conferences are a great place to network with like-minded developers and learn from the best developers in our field. Thousands of conferences happening around the world, but not all of them are equally good. Below is my list of the best software development conferences of all time. **I personally attended every conference on the list**.

DevTernity is the top 3 developer conference in Europe. Located in the heart of Europe, in a beautiful city of Riga, this well-organized conference focuses on the core skills paramount to your success ‚Äì code design, software architecture and leadership.

## JokerConf

**Audience**: Java developers ¬∑  **Location:** Saint Petersburg, Russia ¬∑ **Date**: 25‚Äì26 Oct 2019

![Unconference](https://avatars.io/twitter/jugru)
This is one of the best conferences organized by Java User Group in Russia. The venue, the staff, the travel organization and of course the audience is excellent. The conference offers good soft and hard-core talk balance. The only issue is that *some* talks are in Russian. That might scare some international attendees.

CRAFT is the most well-organized general software development conference in Europe. The conference organizers excel at everything they do ‚Äì from organization to the content.

## GOTO Berlin

![Unconference](https://avatars.io/twitter/gotober)

GOTO is a general software development conference that covers wide range of topics from coding to management. The content is very diverse and thought-provoking. The conference allows you to meet new people easily and hang out at one of the expo booths, because there is plenty of breaks and room available between sessions. The conference also runs in Copenhagen and Amsterdam.

## Devoxx Belgium

**Audience**: Java developers ¬∑  **Location:** Antwerp, Belgium ¬∑ **Date**: 4‚Äì8 Nov 2019

![Unconference](https://avatars.io/twitter/devoxx)

Devoxx is an annual community conference organized by the Belgian Java User Group. The conference has become the biggest Java conference in the world. Devoxx sets high standards for other Java conferences. I believe that every Java developer must attend Devoxx at least once (and try Belgian beer). The conference also runs in the London, Poland, Amsterdam and Chicago.

## The Lead Developer

**Audience**: developers, team leaders ¬∑  **Location:** London, UK ¬∑ **Date**: 11‚Äì12 Jun 2019

![Unconference](https://avatars.io/twitter/theleaddev)

As a tech lead, you have to be a great developer. But you also need to be a good team leader, be commercially astute, and stay on top of all the tech developments and trends coming over the horizon. The Lead Developer conference prepares you for a tech leaders role and covers the wide range of topics that every lead developer need to know. Really good conference!

GeekOut is a high-quality conference for Java developers in a cozy city of Tallinn. It's well-organized, has a great venue and speakers lineup. GeekOut gathers 600 participants every year and has a better cost/value ratio than other Java conferences in Northern Europe. GeekOut organizers are seasoned Java practitioners with good understanding of what Java developers need to know.

## QCon San Francisco

![Unconference](https://avatars.io/twitter/qconsf)

QCon is a large conference for senior software engineers and architects on the patterns, practices, and use cases leveraged by the world‚Äôs most innovative software shops. The conference is well-organized, the talks are diverse, most of them are relevant and deeply technical. That I like about the conference is that you can attend hands-on workshops led by industry experts. The conference also runs in New York, San Francisco, London, Brazil, and Shanghai.

## JavaZone

**Audience**: Java developers ¬∑  **Location:** Oslo, Norway ¬∑ **Date**: 10 Sep 2019

![Unconference](https://avatars.io/twitter/javazone)

JavaZone is organized by javaBin, the Norwegian Java User Group. Its goal is to organize a community-driven conference for Java developers where they can learn new things, share knowledge, and socialize. JavaZone is one of the most visited Java conferences in Europe. Every year, the conference gathers many Java champions and takes content quality seriously. The only downside is that the trip can blow your family budget, because Oslo is very expensive city.

## The Principal Developer

**Audience**: development leaders ¬∑ **Location:** Riga, Latvia ¬∑ **Date**: 23‚Äì24 May 2019

![Conference](/images/the_principal_logo.png)

If conferences are too theoretical for you and you prefer workshops, consider this 2-day masterclass for experienced engineers. The course takes your technical skills and put them on steroids. You will understand how organizations work, learn secrets of good development processes, improve communication, teamwork, and mentoring skills. The goal of this course is to make you the key asset in any modern technology organization. **The course is invite-only and has certain admission requirements.**

## JFokus

**Audience**: Java developers ¬∑ **Location:** Stockholm, Sweden ¬∑ **Date**: 4-6 Feb 2019

![Unconference](https://avatars.io/twitter/jfokus)

JFokus is a general software development conference about literally everything ‚Äì Web, DevOps, IoT, AI, Cloud, Big Data, Future and Trends. Even so, I see a major focus on Java, Kotlin, Scala and other JVM languages (hence "J" the name). It's a large and well-organized conference with some famous speakers on stage. I attended the conference in 2016 together with my team and we liked it.

Build Stuff Lithuania is one of the largest software development events in Baltics. The conference is well-organized, has many good speakers and diversity of talks. What makes this conference particularly great is that it's not just another money-making conference. It's organized with passion and special care about attendees and speakers.

NDC is one of the world's largest independent software conferences covering pretty much everything you need to know about software development.
