Conferences are a great place to network with like-minded developers and learn from the best developers in our field. Thousands of conferences happening around the world, but not all of them are equally good.

## JokerConf

**Location:** Saint Petersburg, Russia ¬∑ **Date**: 25‚Äì26 Oct 2019

![Unconference](https://avatars.io/twitter/jugru)
This is one of the best conferences organized by Java User Group in Russia. The venue, the staff, the travel organization and of course the audience is excellent. The conference offers good soft and hard-core talk balance. **The only issue is that some talks are in Russian and you will probably need a visa.** That might scare some international attendees.

As a tech lead, you have to be a great developer. But you also need to be a good team leader, be commercially astute, and stay on top of all the tech developments and trends coming over the horizon. The Lead Developer conference prepares you for a tech leaders role and covers the wide range of topics that every lead developer need to know. Really good conference!

## JavaZone

**Location:** Oslo, Norway ¬∑ **Date**: 10 Sep 2019

![Unconference](https://avatars.io/twitter/javazone)

JavaZone is organized by javaBin, the Norwegian Java User Group. Its goal is to organize a community-driven conference for Java developers where they can learn new things, share knowledge, and socialize. JavaZone is one of the most visited Java conferences in Europe. Every year, the conference gathers many Java champions and takes content quality seriously. The only downside is that the trip can blow your family budget, because Oslo is very expensive city.
