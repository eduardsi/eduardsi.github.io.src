title: Job Promotion Is a Trap
location: Vilnius, Lithuania
---


We love job promotion. The promotion gives us a sense of career progress:

junior developer → developer → senior developer → principal developer → architect → senior architect → chief architect → CTO  →  CIO (Career Is Over).

With every unlocked achievement, we earn more $, and our social status grows. We are moving towards our dream. We are happy, and life is good.

> But job promotion is a tool that employers use, to make us stay at the company longer.

To make you stay at the company, employers must give you what you need – recognition and a sense of progress.

To keep you happy, the promotion must be regular. Sooner or later, like in Mexico, all programmers in your company will become Señors. Reaching the highest rank is also not hard – **you just have to stay in the company longer than others**.

Congratulations, you are Chief Software Architect. Your friends envy you, and your social status is high. To make things worse, the employer pays you 50% above the market average. Now you are happy to do tedious paperwork, attend meetings and draw boxes.

What can go wrong?

> The company goes out of business.

You start attending job interviews. After a series of devastating rejections, you understand that you are not as good as you thought. You are nothing. The money and social status you had is gone. For a long time, you were living inside the bubble:

Remember:

> Your current job title means nothing. It's just an internal measure.

The more the company needs you, the more tricks it will apply to keep you. The company will feed you with promises, loud job titles, and bonuses. But that's an illusion. No one cares about your career and safety. Job security is like Santa Claus – it does not exist. Your career and safety is your responsibility. 

> Validate your seniority.

Even if you have a good job, attend job interviews often. At least 3 times in a year. I also recommend setting up a reminder.

> Try different companies located in different countries.

Getting a job in a small country is not the same as getting a job in London or Silicon Valley. Try places with developed IT market and high competition. You will know how demanded you are on the global market. 

Attending job interview remotely, in a different country, is your testing environment. Your country is your production. Life-hack: you can change your LinkedIn location to London and buy a [disposable mobile number](https://hushed.com/). There are thousands of companies looking for developers.

> Regular job interviews won't let you get trapped in a bubble.

Interviews will reveal a lack of necessary technical, problem-solving or communication skills. With every interview, you will learn, improve and become better. 

One day, getting a job in a highly-competitive Valley won't be a problem. You will have many job opportunities. Job opportunities are essential, because

> Seniority is the number of job opportunities you have, not your current job title.

Stop living in a bubble. **Schedule your next job interview today.**
