title: You Are Not A Software Developer
location: Riga, Latvia

When I started my career in software development, I thought that my job is to write code. Every time my customer wanted a feature, my first solution was to code it. No questions asked. 

Over the years, I realized that sometimes writing code is not the best solution to the problem. Worse, more code produces more problems. 

Remember the universal law of software development?

> e = mcÂ²

Or

> errors = (more code)Â²

The more code you write, the more your team and the team after it has to maintain. More code leads to more complexity. Mode code leads to more bugs. 

While you're writing code, other important work is idle. Writing well-tested, clean code takes a lot of time. Coding is expensive. 

Because the code is expensive, you need to reduce the amount of produced code. But first, stop viewing yourself as a software developer.

 > You are a problem solver.

A for-profit company wants to make money and reduce expenses. Then the company hires you to solve problems that prevent it from becoming rich. 

Stop thinking about code and features. Think about how to save and make money. 

- Is testing slow? Become a tester. 
- Is hiring not going well? Speak at a meetup and advertise your company.
- Is your team not productive enough? Bring them coffee.

Your job title doesn't matter. Ego doesn't matter either.

Titles, roles, and responsibilities are distracting us from what matters to our customers. It's **money**.

**Your job is to understand how the company is making money, help it make more money and reduce expenses**. Once you know that, you will quickly become the most valuable asset in the company.

Thinking in money can help choose the next skill for development. For example:

- **Serverless**: pay only for resources you consume, spend less time on capacity planning = ðŸ’°ðŸ’°ðŸ’°

- **TDD**: shorter feedback cycle, fewer bugs = ðŸ’°ðŸ’°ðŸ’°

- **Soft Skills**: inspire teammates, so they are more productive and happy = ðŸ’°ðŸ’°ðŸ’°

If you don't know what to learn nextâ€Šâ€”â€Šanswer a simple question:

Very unlikely it's another web framework written in JavaScript.
