## Whether "positive" or "negative", performance-based or pleasure-based, from a systematic point of view, social pressure is an example of a positive feedback loop. The more members of a social group exhibit some kind of behavior, the more remaining members will feel pressured into adopting the same behavior. And before you know it, the whole group is doing exactly the same thing. Whether it's TDD or LSD, suddently they're all in it together.
