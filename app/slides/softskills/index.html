## Whether "positive" or "negative", performance-based or pleasure-based, from a systematic point of view, social pressure is an example of a positive feedback loop. The more members of a social group exhibit some kind of behavior, the more remaining members will feel pressured into adopting the same behavior. And before you know it, the whole group is doing exactly the same thing. Whether it's TDD or LSD, suddently they're all in it together.

## Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Almost everything – all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure – these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.
