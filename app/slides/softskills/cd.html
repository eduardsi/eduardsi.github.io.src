# Personal KanBan
???
I plan the next day 15 minutes before the end of my working day
Some tasks are auto-generated before I plan them for tomorrow (exercising, reading book, send water cooler data)
I wake up and just get shit done w/o much planning and thinking.
I see how much work can I accomplish a day, satisfaction
Limits on Backlog - it lets me know when to stop taking new work, ideas

# Remote
???
- Last Friday, Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer banned employees from working remotely.
- Book!
- It's not just standing up (GIFTS - Good start, support Improvement, reinforce Focus, sense of Team, communicate Status)
- __What you did to change the world yesterday?
- __How you are going to crush it today
- __How you are going to blast through any obstacles unfortunate enough to be standing in your way?
- That's the way we work!
