## What?
### A methodology for reducing the **cost**, **time** and **risk** of delivering incremental changes to users.
## Qualities
### 1. Software is always in shippable state once code is pushed into the mainline (including infrastructure, configuration, data)
### 2. Push-button deployment for any desired version
]
???
**What**
- cost (optimize, automate)
- time (eliminate bottlenecks and waste, reducing wip)
- risk (small increments, reliability (no manual steps, consisteny), rollbacks, resiliance, mmtd, mmtr)
-
1. No need to wait for off-peak hours; non-ready features are deployed too;
2. Including old versions, rollbacks

# Anatomy of Deployment Pipeline

Fail-fast

---
background-image: url(pipeline_classic.png)
## All changes to production go through deployment pipeline
???
Easy to ensure - you just restrict deployment from local machines.

---
background-image: url(pipeline_classic.png)
## All changes to production go through version control (from mainline!)
???
- No release branches! No "quick fixes"!
- RB evil - Bug fixing: you fix it twice. In different codebases. Do you write tests twice too?
- No releases from feature branches.

---
background-image: url(pipeline_classic.png)
## Build only once

# Commit Stage

---
# Continuous Integration compliance checklist
### 1. All developers push the code at least once a day (to Mainline)
### 2. All developers run tests locally before pushing the code (and never push the code if tests fail)
### 3. **Every change** results in a build and tests run
### 4. Developers never push the code if a build is broken (why the build is broken if #3 is true?)
### 5. Build is **always** fixed within ten minutes of it going red
???
2. not daily, every H. but every build!

---

# I will work in a branch and sync with Mainline every day.
## (and push when my feature is ready)
???
But what if no one pushes like you do?

---
class: center, middle, bad
# I will use Mainline as a primary tool for identifying regression in my code

---
# CI changes dynamics of a game
### - No painful merges (try aggressive refactoring w/o CI)
### - Small increments (easier code review, more opportunities for pairing)
### - Evergreen Mainline requires engineering rigor (TDD, preflight quality control)
### - Feature branching becomes unnecessary (brings back synchronous code reviews)
### - Faster feedback from Sheriff on Duty (SoD)
### - Faster feedback from downstream quality gates (if any)
???
- Not only SoD, but all workstreams can see and use your code - awesome!
- One goal, extra care. If someone can release "in a special way", he doesn't care.

# Anti-pattern: Feature Toggles introduce additional failure mode

---
class: center, middle
> ### Release toggles are a useful technique and lots of teams use them. However they should be your last choice when you're dealing with putting features into production. Your first choice should be to break the feature down so you can safely introduce parts of the feature into the product. The advantages of doing this are the same ones as any strategy based on small, frequent releases. You reduce the risk of things going wrong and you get valuable feedback on how users actually use the feature that will improve the enhancements you make later.

e5f4b49 Re-adding ConfigurationPostProcessorTests after its brief removal in r814. @Ignore-ing the testCglibClassesAreLoadedJustInTimeForEnhancement() method as it turns out this was one of the culprits in the recent build breakage. The classloader hacking causes subtle downstream effects, breaking unrelated tests. The test method is still useful, but should only be run on a manual basis to ensure CGLIB is not prematurely classloaded, and should not be run as part of the automated build.
2db0f12 fixed two build-breaking issues: + reverted ClassMetadataReadingVisitor to revision 794 + eliminated ConfigurationPostProcessorTests until further investigation determines why it causes downstream tests to fail (such as the seemingly unrelated ClassPathXmlApplicationContextTests)

# Configuration management
no internal @Profiles. No env-soecific ifs

---


---
- Application must be environment agnostic. No env-conditionals inside, no deciding which configuration to load.
- Version Controlled
- Journalled - who/when/what

---
- configuration is part of app release (12-factor app style)
- configuration is versioned, but lives inpedendently

---
Spring Boot style
https://spring.io/blog/2015/01/13/configuring-it-all-out-or-12-factor-app-style-configuration-with-spring
???
@Value("$(configurationKey)") String configurationKey
- Local development configuration in local .yaml file
- Transforms runtime parameters -Dkey=value and environment variables () into configuration
- Other configuration on GitHub. /refresh endpoint with @RefreshScope beans

---

/env

Dealing with Dynamic infrastructure (e.g. auto-scaling). Consul to the rescue! What about less dynamic configuration?

So, you keep Configuration Templates in GitHub and use git2consul. consul-template listen for Consul and generates configuration - (discovered stuff from Consul, credentials from Vault, other stuff hard-coded)

---
Problem! Ephemeral servers? IP changes! Docker containers spin up! New instances get added. What if servers die? :-) How to unregister it?
Configuration dependency inversion.

- Docker pre-bundled. Slow. Env-specific container :(
- Phoenix server - the same.
- Data and configuration has different change cadence than the app.

12-factor app
![](12factor_config.png)
The source of environment configuration should be read when preparing a release, and that any change to config, just like with a change to code, results in a new release.
???
- App + configuration = single, versioned deploy unit. Rollback (capistrano keeps old versions and rollback command)
- I WOULD ARGUE: feature toggles? gradual rollouts? thread pool size?

---
background-image:url(12factor_env.png)
The environment is right there. Use it.

---
background-image:url(envdir.png)

---
One of the biggest misinterpretations is people thinking 12factor says “config should never be in a file anywhere”.

12factor says config should not be in a file in your app, and your app should read from the environment. It has very little to say about where the environment might be sourced from.

You’ll almost certainly have your config in some files somewhere.

Update: This may be hiera if you use Puppet, or via some other configuration management system, or just plain files but in a different repo. 12factor primarily talks about building apps and not about building the environment they are deployed to.

The point is that:

Wherever you store your config, it is distinct from the app
Your app reads its config from the environment

---
So, changing consul and restarting the app is kinda... Not 2-factor app friendly.
???
if your code and config is managed in separate lifecycles, it ain’t Twelve Factor compatible.

---
\- It doesn’t appear to leave any room for runtime config changes
\- It’s not completely clear how it would work with dynamic service discovery
Sometimes, however, the advantages of predictable, easy to reason about deployments outweigh the benefits of such niceties


## Co-located (spirit of 12-factor app, where configuration changes together with app and is part of release. How do you A/B test this stuff?. You probbaly have infarstructure of A/B already. Now you need two :-)
## GitHub
## etcd (key-value store actually)

---
Which parts to reload? Much easier to restart the whole app!

- Dynamic AWS access keys! Cannot be stolen, as they do not exist before they are read! Every client has different keys - wohoo.
- Cassandra, MySQL, Postgres, SSH!
???
SSH - do not need to share private key for EC2 :-)


---
Unsealing vault (on every start). Ouch! Because the master key is not stored, but generated every time Vault is started.

---
- all operations wiht secret are leased! No exceptions.
- Pre-bundling secrets in S3 stored images?
- Fine-grained control which access tokens can access which secrets.
- OK, what about audit log? e.g. which app accessed the key, when
- Servers must know and get the secret / a key to decrypt the data. Many servers!

---
class: center, middle
## Our recommended approach to use Vault with any configuration manage tool is to move the secret retrieval and renewal into a runtime process instead of a build time process.
###- [excerpt](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/using-hashicorp-vault-with-chef.html) from Vault documentation
???
- Unable to handle lease revocation events
- Unable to handle secret updates
- Can easily become stale
- Cannot use secrets that require lease renewal (read on)

---
Then when applications request access to those secrets, Vault does not give out the root credentials
