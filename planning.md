# I plan my life here

## Long-term plan

At 40, I want to live in my house in Naples, Florida with my beautiful wife Julia and kids. I want to continue educating developers by running workshops and speaking on public. **That makes me tick.**

To achive my goal, I need to be visible on the public:
- write a blog
- write a book
- speak at conferences
