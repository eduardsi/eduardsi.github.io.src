As a programmer, I've been doing commercial software development for 10 years. I quckly grew from a developer to architect, from architect to engineering manager. Then I quit full-time job and spent 3 years consulting CTOs in Riga and London. Thanks to Bitcoin and ~~luck~~ [lifehacks](/training), I retired early. Today, I develop my tech startup [DevTube](https://dev.tube) (#1 Hackernews, #3 ProductHunt). It's a hub for developer videos. 

As a trainer, [I teach developers practical lifehacks](/training).

As a speaker, [I regularly appear on technical conferences and meetups](/speaking).

As a conference organiser, I lead [DevTernity](https://devternity.com). DevTernity is a mix of inspiring talks and practical workshops. No agile and marketing bullshit.
