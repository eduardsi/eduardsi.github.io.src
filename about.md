I've been doing commercial software development for over 15 years, primarily in Java. I quickly grew from a developer to architect, from architect to software engineering manager, from manager to IT director. Today, I keep writing code, mentor software developers and their managers.

 Iâ€™m an Oracle Certified Master and Java Enterprise Architect (OCMEA), Certified Scrum Master, Certified Product Owner, Certified Project Management Professional (PMP), and an ICF certified coach.
