As a programmer, I've been doing commercial software development for 10 years. I quickly grew from a developer to architect, from architect to engineering manager. Then I quit the full-time job and spent 3 years consulting CTOs in Riga and London. 

Thanks to Bitcoin and ~~luck~~ [lifehacks](/training), I retired early. Today, I develop my tech startup [DevTube](https://dev.tube) (#1 Hackernews, #3 ProductHunt). It's a hub for developer videos. 

I am the author of ðŸ“š[mustread.tech](https://mustread.tech). It's an open source and crowd-sourced book listing.

As a trainer, I teach developers [practical lifehacks](/training).

As a speaker, [I regularly appear](/speaking) at conferences and meetups.

As a conference organizer, I've been leading [DevTernity](https://devternity.com) since 2015.
