I've been doing commercial software development for over fifteen years, primarily using Java ecosystem. I quickly grew from a developer to architect, from architect to engineering manager, from manager to IT director. Today I keep writing code, mentoring software engineers, and their managers.

 Iâ€™m a certified Enterprise Architect (OCMEA), certified Scrum Master, certified Product Owner, certified Project Management Professional (PMP), ICF certified coach, and a certified good guy.
