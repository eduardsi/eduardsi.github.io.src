My name is Eduards Sizovs  /É›dwÉ™rd sÉªzov/. I am a software developer, trainer, speaker, and conference organizer from <span class="flag-icon flag-icon-squared flag-icon-lv"></span> Riga, Latvia. I am {{age}} years old.

Iâ€™ve been involved in enterprise software development for over 15 years as a developer, architect, CTO, IT director, and independent consultant. Through regular training and mentoring I helped 63 startups, scale-ups, and large enterprises establish good coding culture, fix broken agile process, and accelerate hiring. 

I lead **[DevTernity](https://devternity.com)** conference, where we turn developers into architects and engineering leaders. It has been recognized as one of **[the best developer conferences in Europe](https://itconference.top)**.

I personally spoke at 103 events Worldwide, including conferences with 1000+ attendees. You can see me in action:

In addition to DevTernity, I organize a masterclass for development team leaders â€“ **[The Principal Developer](https://principal.dev)**. I also run **[Effective Java Software Design](https://devchampions.com/training/java)** training. Attendees say that my training is always practical, inspiring, and high-energy. You can hire me to run a training for your team (in English or Russian).

When I have time, I contribute to open-source. I built a bunch of nice projects such as [dev.events](https://dev.events), [mustread.tech](https://mustread.tech), and [PipelinR](https://github.com/sizovs/pipelinr). Among the most successful creations with 200K users is [dev.tube](https://dev.tube) â€“ a crowd-sourced hub for developer videos. I didn't expect it to become so popular.

Iâ€™m a certified Enterprise Architect (OCMEA), certified Scrum Master, certified Product Owner, certified Project Management Professional (PMP), and ICF certified coach. But who cares about certificates anyway.
